            <h2>About Post-Records</h2>
            <p>Post-Records is a completely fictional record store with a comically narrow product line. It is a project page built to showcase Gian Carlos' skillset as a front-end web developer and designer. You are not actually purchasing these records at these prices. The inventory listed however is part of my real life record collection. I may consider crazy offers!</p>
